# PdfZipper

Purpose: To combine and compress a collection of JPEG images into a single PDF file. One Per folder. 

Background: 
The New York Law Journal is eliminating or reducing access to it's archive. We were able to get access to a large trove of Journal issues and permitted to host it to for our students to access. Unfortunately they are a bit unweildy and provided in a series of JPEG files in folders.

A temp was hired to assemble them into PDF files which we are then planning on hosting. 

1.  No Compression was applied to Images, thus  the average PDF was over 200MB. Slow to download, slow to work with.
2.  It takes several minutes for a humen to produce a single pdf. This process is repetative and ripe for automation.
